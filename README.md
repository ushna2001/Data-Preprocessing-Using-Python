# Data-Transformation-and-Model-Optimization
Overview

This project was completed during an internship at the Neurocomputation Lab, NCAI, where the primary objective was to transform a raw dataset of handwritten forms into a more useful and structured dataset, followed by training and optimizing a machine learning model. The dataset consisted of images belonging to 7 different classes, and the goal was to preprocess and enhance the dataset to improve model performance.

Project Steps

1. Dataset Preprocessing

Segmentation: Segmented the relevant parts of the images to focus on the essential data while discarding unnecessary areas. 

Filtering: Applied filtering techniques to improve image quality and remove noise.

White Pixel Padding: Added padding to standardize the size of all images, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.

Patch Scanning: Scanned and extracted patches from the images to create smaller, more manageable datasets for training.

Data Augmentation: Increased the size of the dataset by applying augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, which helped improve model generalization.

3. Data Cleaning

Removed irrelevant or empty images to ensure the dataset contained only useful information. This process significantly improved the quality and utility of the data.

4. Model Training and Optimization

A pre-existing model was provided by a mentor. The model architecture was explained, and the dataset was trained using this model.
Further optimization was performed to fine-tune the model, improving its accuracy and performance. This involved adjusting parameters and refining the training process to achieve the best possible results.

Technologies Used:

Python: For data preprocessing, segmentation, filtering, padding, patch scanning, and data augmentation.
Machine Learning Libraries: Used to train and optimize the provided model.
Collaboration Tools: Worked closely with a mentor to understand the model and implement improvements.

Results:

Successfully transformed a raw dataset into a structured and optimized dataset ready for machine learning applications.
Trained and optimized a machine learning model on the processed dataset, resulting in enhanced accuracy and performance.
